# DevConnector

> Small social network app built with the MERN stack. This is part of [Brad Traversy's](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy) "MERN Stack Front To Back" Udemy course. Static bootstrap-theme is taken from the same course.

You will need to create a keys.js in the server config folder with

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```
